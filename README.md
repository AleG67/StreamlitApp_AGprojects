# StreamlitApp_AGprojects
In this repository you can find the code I used to create my streamlit app plus the python functions and the datasets needed for the projects in the app.

### [You can find the streamlit app here](https://share.streamlit.io/aleg67/streamlitapp_agprojects/main/AGprojects.py)

In the **AGprojects.py** file you can find the code used to create the app. All the functions used in this file are defined in the other python files, divided in:
- **ClassOptions.py:** contains the class used to create the option pricing project, based on the book "Python for Finance" by Yves Hilpisch.
- **FunctionsHRP.py:** contains the functions used to create the Hierarchical Risk Parity examples, took from the code in the book "Advances in financial machine learning" by Marcos Lopez De Prado. 
- **FunctionsInvCha_web.py:** contains the functions I've written in the context of my toy ML trading project (see specific repo for more info).
- **FunctionsThesis.py:** contains the functions I've used to perform the data analysis for my Thesis (see specific repo for more info).
- **pyVaRES.py:** contains the toy library I created to compute VaR and Expected Shortfall (see specific repo for more info).

In the Dataneeded folder you can find all the datasets used in the app.
In the modelsML folder you can find the ML models used in the Investment challenge project.
